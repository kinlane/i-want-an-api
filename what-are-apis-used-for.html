<h1>What Are APIs Used For?</h1>

<p>APIs are launched primarily to give partners that are outside the company "firewall" access to data and resources. But recently, APIs are also being used by more and more of the general public, including non-developers.

<p>APIs are fundamental to driving social networking and media, and are at the heart of just about any cloud service you use today.  But the primary reason APIs are being deployed is to support mobile applications.</p>
